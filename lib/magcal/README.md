The sensor fusion template programs at http://www.freescale.com/sensorfusion are built on top of drivers and MQX Lite RTOS which
are created via the Processor Expert tool.  The "non-generated" files are all represented here.  These files are relatively
board-independent.  Please see https://github.com/memsindustrygroup/Open-Source-Sensor-Fusion/wiki/Portability%20Topics for a 
detailed discussion of how to port the application to your hardware and RTOS.
