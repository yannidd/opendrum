Release Notes for Sensor Fusion Library
This release: Freescale pre-release for build 422
Build date: 7 November 2014

================================= build 422 Changes ===============================
Previous production release: build 420 (build 421 was never formally released)
Changes from build 420:
1.  Angular Rate and Roll/Pitch/Compass heading packets are now turned on by default in mqx_tasks.c.
2.  Events.c command processing modified:
    * so that requested, but unsupported, quaternion type 
      requests result in the quaternion type remaining unchanged.  Some builds previously returned
      unit quaternions for algorithm options that were not included.
    * Command interpreter modified to process incoming bytes one at a time, results in more
      robust communications with some CDC drivers.
3.  drivers.c/.h have a few of modifications to support the new command interpreter, as does mqx_tasks.c.
4.  NMI IRQ callback in Events.c modified to disable NMI in the future.  This was required because 
    supported Freedom boards did not include an NMI pullup.  This item addresses Errata #5 below.
5.  Stripped unused board support defines from magnetic.h
6.  LED initialization added to mqx_tasks.c.
7.  Redundant logic for various board options removed from tasks.c.
8.  An additional UART method is enabled in Processor Expert for all projects.
9.  user_tasks.c modified so that UART bandwidth will not be exceeded for very high fusion rates
